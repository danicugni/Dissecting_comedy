Im not going to lie, I dont like the new Marc Maron special. This is a weird thing to say about a comedy special, its just not entertaining.

New Maron special was all right, until he got to the part about but you know what Mike Pence really wants to do, right? and, like, come on.

Catching up on Netflix stuff. Watched To All the Boys 2, Pain and Gain, and Marc Marons new special. Surprisingly, the Michael Bay movie was the best of the bunch. Marons special isnt as good as his last. Kind of rough love triangle in All the Boys, but still pretty charming

I fell asleep watching the Marc Maron special last night; got abnormally bad sleep and had some anxiety dreams - attributed to our troubling times. Looked at the Netflix tab a little while ago and saw that it had played through the entire Love Is Blind season. Ah, now I get it.

I watched a new Mark Maron special last night, presumably recorded months ago, where he jokes about how the sky could catch fire and it would be five minutes before some rightwing idiot came along talking about how a burning sky is normal, fine, and creates jobs Eerily prescient

PSA: new Marc Maron special is grade A

Watched the new Marc Maron special last night. Pretty interesting how he talks about something really bad needs to happen before people wake up. I think its going to take more than one bad thing at the same damn time. Because here we are and people still arent woke.

This Marc Maron special Bredda

The new Marc Maron special on Netflix is very in the mood of the moment, but hes funny about it if youre looking for a little comic relief

had a really hard day. cant sleep. so i threw on marc marons most recent special. i dont care about the comedy. his voice calms me. he makes me feel safe. im gonna suck my thumb and sleep sound while marc complains about this or that and i know one day well fuck.

Lets see how long I last with this new Maron special. Over/under is 7 minutes.

Oh fuck yes did I need a new Marc Maron special.

Oh my god in his new comedy special Marc Maron says he knows he exists because he looks at his cat Monkey and Monkey is there so he knows hes there and get Gertrude Stein on the horn because I AM I BECAUSE MY LITTLE DOG KNOWS MEEEE!!!

Marc Maron spends about roughly ten minutes of his new special talking about Marvel.

Example 2 of what kind of a sucker I am. I watched the recent Maron special and then bought turmeric with black pepper.

I tried I really did. Marc Maron new @netflix special was just horrible. Not engaging at all. Maybe the last 58 minutes are amazing. Guess I will never know

im not a marc maron acolyte by any means but the bit in his new special where he talks about how public response to trump refusing to leave office would be everyone wincing and shrugging and just being like i dont know, what do we do? is uncomfortably on point

my day is goign to be 50% excitement for this maron special and 50% dread for the end of Bernie Sanders. this day needs to end. and I need coconut cake. and a flat white. and i am going to it.
